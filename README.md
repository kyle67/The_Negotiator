[The Negotiator](https://pages.github.com/).  will act as a broker for car dealers and agents. The app will prompt car dealers to provide information for insurance  providers. The information given will allow insurance providers to contact car dealers and provide them with a quote based  on the plan they request. In return car dealers will be offered competitive prices for their insurance.

      - The user will register and login to the website with a email and password.The Passport package will allow users to log in with username and password, or other third party verifications such as Facebook/Google.The password hashing middleware which we use to compliment Passport’s functionality is the Bcrypt package. This tool allows us to save the user in the database to later compare with the password used when generating their authentication token. Bcrypt adds 'salt' onto this concept by adding extra random characters onto the password that gets hashed. So the resulting hash is always different for the same input password. This prevents people from building a dictionary of hashes that corespond to the password that made them.

    - [Sequelize](#typo3-extension-repository)
      - Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js. It has dozens of cool features like synchronization, association, and validation. It also has support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and MSSQL.
     
    - [Bcrypt](#typo3-extension-repository)
      - Bcrypt is a password hashing function. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.
    - [Passport](#typo3-extension-repository)
      - Passport is authentication middleware for Node. js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
